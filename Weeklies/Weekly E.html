		<h1 class="weeklyText"> This week I wasnâ€™t able to do much in the way of coding. We did not have class on Wednesday and I was absent on Friday, leading to me focusing a lot more on other classwork. I did gain a better understanding of Javascript through some research about functions. I learned a bit about Javascript a long time ago when I took some free classes online, and I am slowly remembering parts of those lessons as I experiment more and more with coding. I have brainstormed a bit more about the aesthetic of my project, and decided on the models I am going to use for the puzzle boxes. There will be one central puzzle on the main page that involves a dial and a simple math problem. The next page will introduce two more puzzles, one that will take the viewer to my exercises page, and one that will take the viewer to the weeklies section. The first puzzle will be a combination lock that involves a four digit number. The second puzzle will be a rotary lock that requires the viewer to align 5 panels into a certina orientation before proceeding. I want the overall feel of the site to be of an old forgotten place, one that has lots of wear and tear on it. I also want the technology to seem more retro, with displays acting like old dos computers and early gaming systems. The most important part of the project will be figuring out how to make everything work, and I may have to cut some corners if I am unable to solve the problems that Javascript will present me with.
