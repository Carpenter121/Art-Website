		<h1 class="weeklyText"> This week we began working on our personal websites. I ran into some issues when working on overlapping boxes in a specific manner. My main goal was to create a fake combination lock using a series of overlapping images to simulate motion. The image underneath would be composed of a pre-rendered picture of the body of the lock. I would then use cut out images of the dials and layer those over the body. Through the use of Javascript, I would allow those images to rotate creating the illusion that the user was turning the locks in the combination. When I started attempting to solve this issue the first problem that I ran into was how to actually keep the shapes together. With the help of my professor, we figured out how to construct the hierarchy such that one square would inherit the transformations of its parent. Using the absolute position function, we could then move the shape inside of its parentâ€™s space while retaining its position relative to the parent object. The next issue to solve was how to center both of them on the page, and this issue was not able to be fully solved. I will continue to work on figuring out a solution to this, and after this problem is solved the rest of the project should be fairly easy. The website will be fairly simplistic other than the puzzle devices. I hope that I can continue to better my understanding of Javascript and create a comprehensive site that involves challenging puzzles and a cool aesthetic.
