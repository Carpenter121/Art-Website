		<h1 class="weeklyText"> This week we learned a lot about for loops in Javascript, and how to use them in tandem with one another to do a lot of tasks very quickly. This has actually arisen a thought within myself of being able to code a very simple game in Javascript, using p5 to generate some of the graphics while making some of them on my own. I want to create some form of shooter, with the main graphics being placed on the screen. The hud would consist of an ammo counter and the gun itself, which would have a very basic reload animation. I would use WEBGL to generate a 3D environment, and create a camera that moves with the mouse cursor. I can then employ a very old method of hit registration by creating a long invisible rectangle that extends from the camera out into space and rotates along with it. If the rectangle is intersecting with the target, then it counts as a hit. This is quite an ambitious project, but I think that it would be very fun to pursue and I may start it in exercise 5. I want to pursue it in more detail for the final.

            In the exercise, I think I will use the for loop to generate the bullets or some other sort of environmental attributes. I think I can also utilize a for loop to create the reload animation and the walking cycle.

            The enemies in this game would simply be either 2D cutouts or 3D primitives, as the effort required to create good looking models is just not within my timeframe this semester. I want to do some research into the precision of being able to detect intersections, especially in a 3D space. I think that for loops could also be used to create interesting bullet impacts, such as cracks and smoke generation, but I will likely not have time for things like that. I think that success would be even creating an environment that the player was able to move around in. Everything else would come easily from there.
