		<h1 class="weeklyText"> This week I have solved all of the problems that I was having with my movement controls. I was able to follow a tutorial on youtube about building a first person camera that used an additional library called math.js. This program allowed me to create a movement system that changes the forward direction based on the camera, as well as to create a vector shape that extends to a floating object that is far away. With these two items in place the only other hard part of the code to write will be the enemy movements themselves. I need to find a way to make the enemies move toward the player as they themselves move. I also need to find a way to set the speed of the enemies. This week I have also done a bit of looking into how I will get the overlay art to function, and I have found a few solutions but none of them have been tested. This project is going to be due right along with another photography project, and I am hoping to have enough time to polish the rest of the game and make it run smoothly.

            Going forward, I want to look more into coding specifically for game design purposes. I do enjoy making internet based art, but it has a hard time meshing with my field of interest. I am glad to have learned some of the fundamental principles of coding from this class, and I am sure that these principles will help me in understanding other languages. I want to start to develop my understanding of unity and other engines, and how to actually import my assets into a meaningful environment that will allow other people to use them. I think that coding as a whole has been a successful side venture for me to look into, and I am glad that I have chosen to take these classes. I wish that more artistic applications were taught in a normal CSE curriculum, because I have met quite a few CSE majors at accad that say that they enjoy coding for games much more than software development.
