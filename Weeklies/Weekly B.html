		<h1 class="weeklyText"> This week we continued our lessons on HTML, going over some placement tags that will help with organizing information on the pages. One new thing I learned this week during this morning’s class was the use of the pre tag, as I never knew there was a way to preserve text formatting inside of CSS. I also learned that there will be many extra steps when it comes to formatting bootstrap to work with my github repository, and that I will need to incorporate some workarounds in order to fully allow the framework to function. For this week’s assignments we are tasked with building two simple sites to experiment with linking pages and styling CSS. For my poetry exercise, I am using a poem about pizza. For this poem I will try to create one instance of the poem being spread out around the surface of a pizza like toppings. For another instance, I want to style the words that describe the toppings in unique colors and add a hover effect to them. I am still thinking about how I will do the other three instances. For exercise 2, I think it would be fun to create a series of 3D rendered stills to facilitate the choice of your own adventure game. I will attempt to render out a series of stills to act as backgrounds for the text adventure, and each choice will lead the player to a new room.

	I have thought about the implications of CSS in my career, and I am still questioning the extent that learning programming will help me. I know that it will be a good bridge to communicate with front end developers, and create better assets for other teams. I hope that it will also help me with coding scripts to run in my animation softwares, as I have seen a lot of professionals do this regularly. I hope that I can start to put an extra spin on some of the exercises in this class, to help me practice more and to not just learn the same material over again. I also hope that I can use my final project to better my existing website, because creating a website from scratch feels redundant to me. I enjoyed the discussion this week as well, bringing up the concept of UX and the ways in which AI technology and automated systems attempt to recreate life. I think that technology will someday develop into creating human androids that will fill the gaps where virtual programs cannot.
