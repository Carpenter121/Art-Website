		<h1 class="weeklyText"> This week I learned more about how to place items in a static grid. I think that the most important part of organizing things is being able to know where an element will be inside of a page. I began thinking about how I want to design my website and I got inspired by an old game called Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes. It is a party game in which one player must defuse a bomb while being given instructions by another player. I think it would be very interesting to design my website around puzzles that have to be solved in order to access content on my site. I enjoyed learning about the framework free way of creating static grids, as I used to use bootstrap and fluid containers to lay out my site. It is interesting to discover that there are so many ways to do the same thing in html, with slightly different use cases. Even though I already took a course on HTML, I am finding that there are many things that I didnâ€™t know and would actually have been useful to know when designing my original website. This week I want to look more into github, and exactly how I can use the site to my advantage. There are a lot of resources that I had not previously known about, and I look forward to being able to use those on future projects. I also enjoy using visual studio code, as it seems to be a smoother workplace than Dreamweaver.
