		<h1 class="weeklyText"> This week we learned the basics of html code, and how to use CSS to begin styling page elements. As I have already taken a semester-long course going over HTML and CSS, I am familiar with most of the introductory material, including the history of HTML and its modern uses. For me this class will be an extension of the last one, as I push myself to find new ways to utilize html and further improve my understanding of core concepts. I created a website in my course last semester that is constructed out of HTML, CSS, and the bootstrap framework. This website is a portfolio site that I am using to apply to internships and other career opportunities. My main focus of study is 3D animation and modeling, so the majority of my work shown on the website consists of rendered images and videos. I would like to learn how to import some type of 3D viewer into my website, to make looking at the models easier and more interactive.

		I would also like to learn how to implement a way to upload new projects whenever they arise without having to go in and alter the code of the site. 
	This week it was nice to be introduced to a new interface as well. In my other class we used dreamweaver for almost all of our assignments, but that software seems limited compared to visual studio code. We never used any add ons however, and there may be ways that I don’t know about to use those with dreamweaver as well. Regardless, it is good to get experience with both platforms. I also used github for the first time, and I am still very unfamiliar with exactly how much power the site has. I knew beforehand that the site was used a repository for written blocks of code, but I didn’t know that it could house and host entire websites. I encountered a problem this week with committing my changes to my repository on github, and after clicking the commit button the page just loaded for over 30 minutes. I am not sure whether or not this is an issue with the internet connection, or the file size. I added the entirety of the bootstrap framework into my directory folder, and this may have caused some problems when attempting to upload so many lines of code to github. I will look more into the issue next week in class, to make sure I understand how github interacts with bootstrap and to fix the issue.
