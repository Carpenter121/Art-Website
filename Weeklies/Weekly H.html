		<h1 class="weeklyText"> This week I focused most of my efforts on other projects. I was able to do a bit more research into how to create the hit detection system for my game. The main plan in creating this game is to use a straight line protruding from the camera out into space to detect whether or not an enemy has been hit. To do this I will use a hit detection library that has been created for p5 that allows both 3d and 2d objects to interact. This library is primarily meant for 2d spaces, to allow other shapes to collide with one another. I am going to change this into a 3D space by adding the Z coordinate to some of the functions. I also need to look into the way I will be designing the assets for the game, and the way that p5 handles texture wrapping.

            Something that I want to try doing is simple frame by frame animations for reloading and changing weapons. I want to figure out a way to have p5 draw things in sequence but at a slower speed than 60fps. I know that the framerate can be reduced, but I want to reduce it only for a specific set of items and not for the entire program at once.
            I think that for the most part this game should be fairly doable. As with most projects that I start I have to question the feasibility of my work, because I can be an ambitious designer sometimes. I think that at the very least I want to create a shooter that functions with a single weapon and a square room. After that is working I would like to add another room and another weapon to the game. I also want to think about how to change classes within p5, to trigger events like a color change on hit for the enemies. It should be pretty straightforward to set that up. I might even try to include a few breakpoints for the canvas if I have enough time.
