		<h1 class="weeklyText"> This semester as a whole has been a very busy one. I did not expect to be as busy as I was last year, but I ended up creating another animation project which took up a lot of my time. I would have liked to have spent more time working on projects for this class, but unfortunately the animation process is very demanding of one person. This class has given me a good opportunity to expand my horizons on coding and computer design as a whole. I am glad to have gotten my hands wet with Javascript, and hope to someday learn some more complex coding languages to help with scripting in my 3D animation softwares. I have actually seen a lot of improvement in my overall workflow since week one, and I am getting used to using visual studio code instead of dreamweaver. Visual studio, much like blender, seems to be more of an open source application, where several developers can contribute addons and plugins. Dreamweaver however is in the same space as Maya, with only a single company controlling the features and abilities of the software. I have found that both of these have upsides and downsides, but I am glad that I was able to learn another software to add to my resume. I enjoyed the projects that we did, and the lessons that were taught in class. I though the lectures were insightful and well thought out. The weekly blog posts were a bit tiresome throughout the semester, especially because I had two other courses with weekly assignments due at the same time.

			This led to me forgetting to do a few of the posts both in this class and the other class, but I understand why they need to be there. I also wish we could find a better way to upload files, as using the github repository was often very difficult, and many students still donâ€™t use it. Uploading there is also a bit unreliable, as there is a long wait time before the new and updated page is actually launched. Overall though I had a good semester, and am glad that I took this course.
